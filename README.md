# Optical Flow
    1. Optical flow is the pattern of apparent motion of image objects between two consecutive          
       frames caused by the movement of object or camera
    2. It often serves as a good approximation of the true physical motion projected onto the          
       image plane
    3. Optical flow provides a concise description of both the regions of the image undergoing          
       motion and the velocity of motion

    NOTE: It is probably a good idea to restart the kernel if you ever run these cells, as the tracking algo can sometimes get caught in a loop with your camera


### have Look at optical pyramid for image processing
   
   
    image resolution is imortant as shown in image pyramid in Optical flow
